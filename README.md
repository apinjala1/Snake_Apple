# Snake_Apple
Snake and Apple game 


This program is a thinking game where the goal is to guide the snake to eat all the apples in the correct order. Eat as many apples as you can to grow as long as possible. Use the arrow keys to control your snake and spacebar to pause. If you hit a wall or yourself, the game will be over. Pygame is suitable to create client-side applications that can be potentially wrapped in a standalone executable
